# Trying jest-playwright

This is my playground repo for e2e tests with playwright + jest-playwright-preset.

* Tests in TypeScript
* Custom environment that takes screenshots of all pages in a context
* Tests with multiple windows

## Usage

```
npm install
npm test
```

Screenshots are generated in `screenshots/`
